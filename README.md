# AMP-Toyz

[Maris Tammik](https://github.com/fuzzblob) and [Nathan Glynn](https://github.com/Kionius) coding and audio tool in the Unity Engine. It is named the [Audio Mentoring Project](http://audiomentoring.com/) which braught the two together.

## Features

- Pooled AudioSources
- virtual voice simulation: AudioClip playback without AudioSource/DSP resources
- simple voice management: AudioSource limiting & stealing based on priority and OutputVolume
- custom distance attenuation system
- Sequence, Random, Shuffle & Weighted playback modes
- Fading in & out with a selection of fade curves

## TODO

- random seek offset (Nathan homework)
- stem layer system (music/ambiance)
